    <h1>Beauty</h1>
    <p>
    Ah  Beauty.. Beauty can be found in most things, but in many more instances, beauty is usually found in art. Now in modern times, art can be anything and everything as long as the person that sees it or creates it says its a form of art. Now i would think that there are many people who have view on art and what's not art. Some people think that statues, paintings,music and handheld creations are art. Then there are those who think body parts and things they do with them is art, and they think that things that are weird to see happen and is disgusting is art(kids bodies stuck together) or a lady taking a picture with no top on.

        I can't really define art as art is one thing that can be anything I or anyone think it is.

        The difference though, would be art with a meaning, Back in the old days around the great artist Leonardo da Vinci or those before him, art would mean something. If he drew a lady getting water from a well with a child in her arms, it would give off a certain meaning and people would be drawn to it because some people can relate to it. What made it better was that there was only one version of a piece of art which made it scarce to see something like that anywhere else other than one place, and that was the beauty of it. Another example is the Roman Cathedral, there was only a few built but they all had amazing art in them and people would walk for days on end just to go and see them, just because they were only in one place and had different art in them that they had nowhere else.

	Beauty in art is found differently in every person, art is like a state of mind in which we become who we really are, the person who we keep caged in all the time because we are serious almost all the time and we have no time to be loose and in an environment where no one can judge us. Art can be weird and disgusting and and much as we dont want to call it art, we can't, because art comes in many forms and as the world progresses so will what we call art.
